# Simple Life Blog

<hr>

This project focused on building out a three page, responsive layout.
The project allowed me to use HTML, CSS, Flexbox and Media Queries for responsive design.

The project showcases a fictional three page static layout for a blog named The Simple Life.
It features a home page, about me page and a read more page.
